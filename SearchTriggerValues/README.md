# Search Trigger values

Code for searching trigger events that can be added in Vision Brain Analyzer

DISCLAIMER: this code is not meant to be released oficially, and is for academic use. You can contact pieter.vandenberghe@ugent.be if something is not working, but no official support is given to this script.

A csv-file is loaded that contains trigger events. You will need to specify the desired trigger and the number of loops. The specified trigger is corrected to the starting trigger. Subsequently, that trigger is subtracted from a constant value associated with a specific test condition. Finally, these calculated values are exported to an Excel-compatible spreadsheet. The values exported are useful to adjust the trigger timing in Brain Analyzer.
